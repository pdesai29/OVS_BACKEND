# OVS_BACKEND, Server for OVS Project (Online vehicle services) 
<h2>👉 https://ovs-backend.onrender.com</h2>
<h1>❗ Important ❗</h1>
<p>This back-end application is hosted on a free plan of render.com, So, it will be a little slow</p>
<p>The server serves data and handles post requests without any security and authentication </p>
<p> Its job is to only power front-end app hosted over here 👉 https://ovs.pranaydesai.com </p>
<p>Don't change anything else other than the subcategory, the database is limited</p>
<p>This is just a demo application, use dummy data to log in or signUp, Don't use your original credentials which you use for other websites.</p>
<p>The Secure authentication features of both frontend and backend have been disabled.</p>
